   - The displayBarChart function displays a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 bacterial cultures found in the selected sample. The x-axis represents the sample values, and the y-axis represents the OTU IDs. The chart is sorted in descending order, with the highest sample value at the top.

-The displayBubbleChart function displays a bubble chart of all bacterial cultures found in the selected sample. The x-axis represents the OTU IDs, the y-axis represents the sample values, and the size of the bubbles represents the sample values. The color of the bubbles represents the OTU IDs.
-The optionChanged function is called whenever a new sample is selected from the dropdown menu. It then calls the three chart display functions to update the charts with the new sample data.
